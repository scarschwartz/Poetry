the day the bells said stop

one easter morning in a big city
actually a huge city 
in fact some would argue the biggest city ever 
but they would be missing the point
because the point is one easter morning in this above averagely sized city 
the sky was blue and people were walking past museums of contemporary art 
when suddenly the church bells started ringing 
as they had done  every easter since the first church was built
when the city was still small, one of the smallest cities ever
but this year people in the street were saying 
that the bells were perhaps the loudest they’d ever been
and as the day progressed the bells became louder still
that night people in the city couldn’t sleep because the bells were so loud
the next morning, which was rainy and grey, the bells were still ringing 
and that night they were still ringing 
and the next day 
ringing 
and the next week etc
but that’s all i can really get out of this idea
the idea being that one easter the church bells didn’t stop
the idea came while i was watching something on youtube this afternoon
it was an experiment that some american scientists did in the 70s
they filmed a cockroach crawling from the top of the table to the bottom
how it hooked its back legs on to the top of the table
and then swung via gravity until its front legs hit the underside of the table
the scientists wanted to isolate exactly how the cockroach did it
because they thought that it could be good for astronauts to have that skill
so they started making tiny cuts in the cockroaches legs
when the cockroach failed to flip they would know exactly what part of the foot did it
then the video showed the cockroach limping on the table
and then when it tries to flip
it plummets to floor and lands on its back
its a really close up video and you can see the cockroaches eye
the woman standing next to me on the train said “it’s beautiful”
i asked her what is beautiful
she said “the cockroach”
