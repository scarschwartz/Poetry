the day the bells said stop

one easter morning in a big city
actually a huge city 
in fact some would argue the biggest city ever 
but they would be missing the point
because the point is one easter morning in this above averagely sized city 
the sky was blue and people were walking past museums of contemporary art 
when suddenly the church bells started ringing 
as they had done  every easter since the first church was built all those years ago 
when the city was still small, one of the smallest cities ever
but this year the church bells were unusually loud 
people in the street were saying that the bells were perhaps the loudest they’d ever been
and as they day progressed they became louder still
that night people in the city couldn’t sleep because the bells were so loud
the next morning, which was rainy and grey, the bells were still ringing 
and that night they were still ringing 
and the next day 
ringing 
and the next week etc
but that’s all i can really get out of this idea
the idea being that one easter the church bells didn’t stop
now that i’ve written it it doesn’t seem to be saying what i wanted to convey
which was about a something i watched on youtube this afternoon
a video of an experiment that some american scientists did in the 70s
they filmed cockroaches crawling and falling
and then they cut its legs
and it plummeted and fell on its back
and wriggled its legs in the air and at that moment i thought to myself
it is beauty that transcends all
it even transcends death
it even transcends white male privilege
